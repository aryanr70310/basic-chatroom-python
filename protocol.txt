Python version used is python 3.7.4(I have only tested in this version)

The server protocols mentioned in the assignment are implemented by providing the clients and the server a set of commands,
The '/' character is used to signify commands, the client and the server have been provided the same commands,
but only the server host can shutdown the server.

PROTOCOL 1:
If the client types in a message wihout prefixing it with a '/', the message is broadcasted to every client online through the server.

Detailed Command Information:

The commands are not interactive, i.e the server doesn't ask for further inputs after a command is sent
If a command doesn't fit the format specified(or causes any other errors), an error statement will be sent, and the client will just have to retype the command
No responses are required from a user after a command is typed
If the user inputs extra arguments for a command, the command handler just disregards the extra data


PROTOCOL 3:
/quit or /exit: This command is different for the client and server,
For the client, /exit disconnects client from server and closes the application
For the server, /exit closes all connections, saves the database , shuts down the server and closes the application
Format:
/quit
/exit 

PROTOCOL 4:
/users: Lists all users, online and offline and prints them
Format: 
/users

/users_online: Lists all users online and prints them
Format: 
/users_online

/users_offline: Lists all users offline and prints them
Format: 
/users_offline

/change_name: Changes the username of the client, preferences and details won't be altered through
No spaces are allowed in a username
Format: 
/change_name [new_username]

PROTOCOL 2:
/whisper or /msg: These commands allow the client to send private messages to the specified user
Format: 
/whisper [username] [message]
/msg [username] [message]

/bio_write: The client can have a personalized bio, which can be change with this command
Format: 
/bio_write [bio]

/bio_append: This command is for adding a line to the bio
Format: 
/bio_append [Line]

/bio: To view other clients' or your own bio(don't pass an argument if you want to see your own bio)
Format: 
/bio
/bio [username]

/kick: Removes a specified user from the server(Only available to the server host, clients cannot kick other clients)
Format:
/kick [username]

/help: Shows all commands, with a one line description and how to use them
Format:
/help

Explaining my choices:

I've used a prefix to signify commands as this is an easy way to separate commands from messages, making command handling much faster and simpler
The server host is basically a client but has a (HOST) tag attached to them, the Host basically acts as an admin who can help clients use the chatroom,
this is why they have the same commands as a client, furthermore the host has been given an additional commands /kick to remove clients forcibly 
I have not made commands interactive as I feel that would just waste the client's time,
commands should be quick and direct, this also ensures that the server threads don't get stuck on a recv statement
